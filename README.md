## How to Contribute

1. Create a new branch with your first and last name (this should automatically switch you to your new branch)

    If you've already created this branch but aren't currently in it, you can simply omit the -b:

    `git checkout <your-name>`

2. Make your changes to the code!

3. Stage your changes for commit

    `git add .`

4. Commit your changes and add a message describing what you did

    `git commit -m "blah blah blah"`

5. Push your changes

    `git push`

6. Open a pull request on GitHub so someone can review it

**Make sure you `git pull` before making any changes*
